>Migration tools are usually appropriate
>Overall, the CREATE / DROP feature of MetaData is useful for test suites, small and/or new applications, and applications that use short-lived databases. For management of an application database schema over the long term however, a schema management tool such as Alembic, which builds upon SQLAlchemy, is likely a better choice, as it can manage and orchestrate the process of incrementally altering a fixed database schema over time as the design of the application changes.
